			<h2> Below are a list of things you can do while in Barbados </h2>
				<h3> 1. Diving in Barbados </h3>

				<p>  Unlike many of the islands in the Caribbean which are of volcanic origin, Barbados was formed primarily from coral. Diving conditions, including visibility, are good year-round. The average water temperature is mid 80Fs in summer (mid-Apr to Nov) and high 70Fs in winter (Dec to mid-April). </p>
				
				<p>Barbados is an excellent destination for divers of all levels - beginners learning to dive, those looking to get some scuba experience, and seasoned divers. Most dive shops in Barbados offer a full range of PADI certified courses for any skill level. And even the most experienced divers will benefit from teaming up with a local dive shop to locate the best sites and get insider tips! </p>

				<h3> 2. Shopping In Barbados </h3>
				<p> Dutyfree shopping is especially popular, with prices typically being 30 to 50% less than in Europe and North America! When making dutyfree purchases be sure to have your passport and airline ticket with you. Your packages can be delivered to the airport or sea port for your convenience.</p>
				<p> The heart and soul of shopping in Barbados is Broad Street in the capital city, Bridgetown. There you will find several large department stores and duty free shops. In addition to the specialty stores (such as jewellery stores), there are several shopping malls offering a wide variety of products and services</p>
				
				<p> Shopping in Barbados is by no means confined to Bridgetown. There are several smaller towns like Holetown in St.James and Speightstown in St.Peter that feature craft shops and gift shops. Several shopping malls and plazas are also located outside of Bridgetown. Chattel Village shopping areas are becoming increasingly popular in Barbados. These feature shops made in traditional chattel house style and selling souvenirs, gift items, clothing and local arts and crafts. You can find these chattel villages at Holetown, St.James and St.Lawrence Gap, Christ Church.

				<h3> 3. Barbados Cuisine </h3>
				<p> When one thinks of Bajan Food and drinks, you can't help but wonder where this will all lead to. Food and drinks throughout the island of Barbados are a superb combination of present and past recipes that have all been uniquely preserved and creatively manipulated.</p>

				<p>Bajan food and drinks make culinary arts in Barbados truly stand out. An amalgamation of a strong English, Indian and African influence fused with the availability of freshly grown local produce has added further impact to what we now know as our very own Bajan food and drinks.</p>

				 

				<p>Barbados has been christened "The Land of Flying Fish". Its warm surrounding waters abound in microscopic plant and animal organisms which provide sustenance for the flying fish and in turn allow the people of Barbados to benefit from a high-protein dietary main food that has been available for many many many years. It is no wonder that the island's national dish cou-cou and flying fish, consist of this very fish. Cou-Cou is a combination of cornmeal and okra that are further combined with salt, pepper and Barbados' very own Hot Pepper Sauce. This unique staple food is complimented with flying fish.</p>
